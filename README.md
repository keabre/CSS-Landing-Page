# CSS-Landing-Page

This project is from following the foundations course on 'The Odin Project'

I will be creating a web page with only the guidance of a picture of the desired solution of the finished product of the web page along with a file detailing colours and fonts.

My goal on completion of this project is to show myself and others evidence of recently gained 'css flexbox layout mode' knowledge.
